      "description": "This is an advanced course in modern computer vision and machine learning. It contains fundamental concepts from classical computer vision: filtering, matching, indexing and 3D computer vision. On top of that, a large portion of the course focuses on current computer vision methodologies and problems, which build on top of deep learning techniques: detection, segmentation, generation, and vision and language models. This course will introduce the fundamental mathematical concepts behind these tasks and how they can be integrated into modern machine-learning models. The taught material and assessment include both theoretical derivations as well as applied implementations, and students are expected to be proficient with both.",
